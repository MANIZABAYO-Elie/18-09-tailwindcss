        Hybrid vehicles are found in many forms, including cars, 
        pickup trucks, SUVs, minivans, and even sports cars. 
        Some favor efficiency, while others use the gasoline-electric
        combination to notably increase performance. With so many hybrid vehicles available,
        it's difficult to distinguish the merely good from the utterly great.
